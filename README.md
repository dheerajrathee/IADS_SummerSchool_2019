# IADS_SummerSchool_2019

This repository is created for [Institute of Analytics and Data Science Summer School 2019](https://www.iadssummerschool.com/events/analytics-and-data-science-summer-school).

## Course Abstract:
Tree-based models e.g. Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. These models offer a high level of flexibility that leads to an advantage towards capturing the complex non-linear relationships, however, makes these models more prone to memorizing the noise present in data. By aggregating the predictions of several decision trees that are randomly trained, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility feature while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. In this course, participants will learn how to work with tree-based models to solve data science problems in Python.

Everything from using a single tree for regression or classification to more advanced ensemble methods will be covered. Participants start learning about basic CARTs (classification and regression trees) followed by implementation of bagged trees, Random Forests, and boosted trees using the Gradient Boosting Machine, or GBM. The course will include dedicated practical sessions for these techniques and allow the participant to create high performance tree-based models for a real-world dataset.
